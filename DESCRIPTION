             family = "Gostic",

Description: Reconstruct birth-year specific probabilities of immune imprinting to influenza A, using the methods of Gostic et al. (2016) <doi:10.1126/science.aag1322>. Plot, save, or export the calculated probabilities for use in your own research. By default, the package calculates subtype-specific imprinting probabilities, but with user-provided frequency data, it is possible to calculate probabilities for arbitrary kinds of primary exposure to influenza A, including primary vaccination and exposure to specific clades, strains, etc.
